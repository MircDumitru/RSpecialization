-   The system is most useful for conditioning plots
-   Plots are created and annotated with separate functions
-   Plots are typically created with a single function call

### Answer 3

-   Plots are created and annotated with separate functions

-   the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot
-   the line width in the base graphics system
-   the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
-   the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

### Answer 9

-   the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

### Question 10

If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following is a
correct way of doing that?

-   Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF
    file with dev.copy2pdf()
-   Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot,
    then close the device with dev.off().
-   Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then
    close the device with dev.off().
